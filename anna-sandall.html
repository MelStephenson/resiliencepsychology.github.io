      I am a Clinical Psychologist registered to practice in New Zealand. I have worked with people of all ages, and helped them to overcome a wide range of difficulties and problems, no matter how big or small. My areas of interest and expertise are depression, anxiety and physical health problems. Before moving to Auckland, I worked in a number of specialist services in London, including the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma, the National and Specialist OCD Service for children and adolescents, and the National pain management service.

    <p>
      I am primarily trained in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). I have further training in other evidence-based psychological therapies such as Mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Whilst endorsing a structured therapy approach involving practical skills training, I like to work creatively and holistically to help people achieve their goals.
